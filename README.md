# Rest-api-with-Go
This is a simple Go-based RESTful API project using the Gorilla Mux router. The API allows users to manage events with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It includes endpoints for creating new events, retrieving individual or all events, updating event details, and deleting events.
